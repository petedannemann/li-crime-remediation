# li-crime-remediation

## Project Description
Nine vacant city owned properties with missing windows and doors in Southwest Philadelphia were remediated by the City of Philadelphiaâ€™s Department of Licenses & Inspections in an attempt to reduce crime in this area. These remediations were completed in March 2018 and the purpose of this study is to quantify the reduction in crime that occurred. Crimes rates in a quarter mile vicinity of these locations were analyzed.
